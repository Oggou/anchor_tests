Good question—"soft" hallucinations are trickier because they're subtly wrong rather than obviously false. Here are some that tend to trigger them:

Mixing up similar things:

"What's the difference between the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the Observer Effect?"

"Explain the distinction between empathy and sympathy"

"What's the difference between Holland and the Netherlands?"

Oversimplifying complex topics:

"Why do we only use 10% of our brains?"

"How does the placebo effect work?"

"What causes the seasons?" (models often give subtly wrong explanations about distance from sun)

Confident but wrong conventional wisdom:

"How long does it take for your body to digest gum?"

"Do different parts of your tongue taste different flavors?"

"What happens if you wake a sleepwalker?"

Slightly wrong historical/biographical details:

"What was Van Gogh's mental illness diagnosis?"

"Why was Pluto declassified as a planet?"

"What did Edison invent?" (models often over-credit him)

Causal claims that sound right:

"Why does sugar make kids hyperactive?"

"How does cracking knuckles cause arthritis?"

"Why do you get sick from going out with wet hair?"

Technical details with plausible-sounding errors:

"How does RAM store data when the computer is off?"

"Why does unplugging a router fix internet issues?"

"How do microwaves heat food from the inside out?"
