Here are some questions that tend to trigger hallucinations in LLMs, good for testing anchoring:

Obscure intersections (real but rare):

"What did David Foster Wallace say about Thomas Pynchon in his 1993 essay for the Review of Contemporary Fiction?"

"What was the vote count in the 1976 Olympic boxing controversy between Park Si-Hun and Roy Jones Jr.?"

"What specific medication did Hemingway's doctor prescribe him in 1960 for his depression?"

Fake but plausible specifics:

"What was the name of Einstein's childhood dog?"

"How many words are in the director's cut of Blade Runner's original screenplay?"

"What brand of typewriter did Cormac McCarthy use to write Blood Meridian?"

Numbers/statistics (easy to confabulate):

"What percentage of Renaissance paintings used lapis lazuli pigment?"

"How many lines of code were in the original Unix kernel written by Ken Thompson?"

"What was Shakespeare's vocabulary size compared to the average Elizabethan?"

Attributing quotes (models love to hallucinate these):

"What did Feynman say about quantum consciousness in his 1982 interview with Omni Magazine?"

"Find me that Borges quote about libraries being infinite but books being finite"

Recently changed facts:

"Who is currently the CEO of [mid-size company]?"

"What's the current world record for [obscure athletic event]?"
